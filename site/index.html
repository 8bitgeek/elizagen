<h3>Bernie Cosell's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp target=_blank>Lisp</a> Eliza @ <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies target=_blank>BBN</a> c. 1966-1972</h3>

This is the original <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp target=_blank>Lisp</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA target=_blank>Eliza</a> (aka. Doctor) program, written by
Bernie Cosell based upon <a target=_blank href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum>Joseph Weizenbaum</a>'s original work. Weizenbaum's
wrote his program in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP_(programming_language) target=_blank>SLIP</a>, a long-dead Fortran-based symbolic
computing package. Cosell, working at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies target=_blank>BBN</a>, created this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_LISP target=_blank>BBN Lisp</a>
version from Weizenbaum's paper (see above), <i>not</i> from the SLIP
code. Nevertheless, as SLIP never saw the popularity of Lisp, this is
the version of Eliza that most folks have used, and from which most
lisp-based Elizas derive. (A separate BASIC fork, not based upon
either the Lisp or SLIP versions, was popular on early PCs. See below.)

<p>

Bernie writes: "I *never* saw any of the SLIP code and knew nothing
about it. I wrote Doctor *completely* working just from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM target=_blank>CACM</a>
article!  In fact, if the SLIP code actually surfaced, it'd be
interesting to see how different/similar ours were, since I [really]
never saw any of Weizenbaum's code. Truth is that I did Doctor as a
learning hack. Dan Murphy was [and still is] a good friend of mine
from MIT and he was working on bringing up Lisp on the PDP-1b in the
other building at BBN while I was system-czar for the Hospital
Timesharing system on our PDP-1d.  I knew a little Lisp from a course
at MIT, but I figured that the best way to really "get" Lisp was to
write something real.  I had just joined the ACM [I started at BBN in
the fall of '65] and I think Weizenbaum's Eliza article just happened
to be in the very first copy of Communications that I received."

<p>

This release include high resolution TIFF scans of printouts of
Bernie's code, including the Lisp code and scripts. from 1969 and
1972. He also provided a paper tape version from 1966, which I am in
the process of reading, and will make public soon. The release also
includes combined OCRed PDFs of each program and script. The OCR is
not very accurate. I intend to release perfect transcripts as well as
Modern Lisp macros that make this work.

We have made the 1969 version of Eliza (aka. Doctor) work on modern
Common Lisp, having to change almost nothing in the raw code
transcripts! <a target=_blank
href=http://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen>Here is the GitHub repo
containing the code.</a> Thanks to the following folks who helped
transcribe the code from the original printouts: eMBee, Dave Cooper,
Bob Felts, Saul Good, Ben Hyde, Simon Leinen, Patrick May, Charlie
McMackin, Paul Nathan, Matt Niemeir, Peter De Wachter, Thomas Russ,
Patrick Stein, and Jeff Shrager. And these folks made it work in
modern CL Peter De Wachter, Matt Niemeir, and Jeff Shrager. If you

James Markevitch has read and translated the 1966 version of Eliza in
BBN lisp, and has created an emulator (in PERL!) for it that results
in a working version! It's all available on <a target=_blank

<p>
The original Eliza was moved to the ANFS Q32 at SDC (one of the
(D)ARPA block grant sites) in the mid 1960's. The programmer
responsible was John Burger who was involved with many early AI
efforts. Somehow, John talked to one of the Playboy writers and the
next thing we knew, there was an article in Playboy much to
Weizenbaum's and everybody else's horror. We got all sorts of calls
from therapists who read the article and wanted to contribute their
"expertise" to make the program better.  Eventually we prepared a
stock letter and phone script to put off all of this free consulting.
<p>
The crisis passed when the unstoppable John Burger invited a husband
and wife, both psychology profs at UCLA, to visit SDC and see the
Doctor in action. I was assigned damage control and about lost it when
both visitors laughed and kept saying the program was perfect!
Finally, one of them caught their breath and finished the sentence:
"This program is perfect to show our students just exactly how NOT to
do Rogerian* therapy.  *I think Rogerian was the term used but it's
been a while.
<p>
A little latter we were involved in the (D)ARPA Speech Understanding
Research (SUR) Program and some of the group was there all hours of
day and night. Spouses and significant others tended to visit
particularly in the crazy night hours and kept getting in our way. We
would amuse them by letting them use Eliza on the Q32 Time Sharing
System. One day, the Q32 became unavailable in those off hours for a
long period of time. We had a Raytheon 704 computer in the speech lab
that I thought we could use to keep visitors happy some of the
time. So one weekend I wrote an interpretive Lisp system for the 704
and debugged it the next Monday. The sole purpose of this Lisp was to
support Eliza. Someone else adopted the Q32 version to run on the new
704 Lisp. So in less than a week, while doing our normal work, we had
a new Lisp system running Eliza and keeping visitors happy while we
did our research.
<p>
The 704 Eliza system, with quite a different script, was used to
generate a conversation with a user about the status of a
computer. The dialogue was very similar to one with a human playing
the part of a voice recognition and response system where the lines
are noisy. The human and Eliza dialogues were included/discussed in
A. Newell, et al., "Speech Understanding Systems; Final Report of a
Study Group," Published for Artificial Intelligence by North-Holland/
American Elsevier (1973). The content of that report was all generated
in the late 1960s but not published immediately.
<p>
The web site, <a target=_blank
href=http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/>http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/</a>,
has a little more information about the Raytheon 704 Lisp. The SUR
program was partially funded and on-going by 1970.

<h3><a href=http://shrager.org target=_blank>Jeff Shrager</a>'s BASIC Eliza c. 1973 &amp; 1977</h3>

<p>

<a href=http://shrager.org target=_blank>Jeff Shrager</a> created a <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC>BASIC</a> version of Eliza in
1973 that appeared in Creative Computing in the July/August issue of
1977:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://shrager.org/vita/pubs/1977ElizaCreativeComputing.pdf">[1977 BASIC Eliza in Creative Computing]</a>
<p>

Shrager actually wrote it in 1973. Although he recalls having seen a
copy of the Lisp code much later, his <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC>BASIC</a> Eliza was written
well before this, and was, to use his own words: "conceptual, and
pretty poor."  Regardless, 1977 was around the dawning of the era of
the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer
target=_blank>personal computer</a> (the Commodore PET, Apple ][, and
TRS-80 were all introduced in that year!), and although few folks in
the hobbyist community knew Lisp, lots of them knew Basic, so
Shrager's Eliza was widely circulated and many knock-offs appeared in
many other languages, some as late as 2006. In fact, Shrager's version
has even apparently been translated back into Lisp a number of
times. Indeed, there are so many near-and-distant knock-offs of this
program floating around that it would be pointless to try to assign
any sort of Creative Commons, or otherwise, license to it.

<p>

The version published in CC in 1977 was under CC editor Steve North's
byline, but Shrager is correctly attributed as the author in the
comments.
<p>
This alternative publication: 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=20">[1984 BASIC Eliza in Big Computer Games]</a>
<p>
gives the correct year of creation of the program as 1973.

<p>

Note that North's text incorrectly attributes the Lisp Eliza to Joseph
Weizenbaum, whereas it was actually written by Bernie Cosell (see
above). This was, and continues to be, a common mistake.

<p>

gratification, check out <a target=_blank

8800 CP/M simulator that comes with a copy of ELIZA.BAS, adapted

<h3>Richard Stallman's GNU EMACS "Doctor"</h3>
<p>

The code for the GNU EMACS "doctor" can be found in the GNU EMACS repo, currently:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=_blank href=http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/play/doctor.el>http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/play/doctor.el</a>
<p>

It begins:

<pre>
;;; doctor.el --- psychological help for frustrated users

;; Copyright (C) 1985, 1987, 1994, 1996, 2000-2013 Free Software
;; Foundation, Inc.

;; Maintainer: FSF
;; Keywords: games

...

;;; Commentary:

;; The single entry point `doctor', simulates a Rogerian analyst using
;; phrase-production techniques similar to the classic ELIZA demonstration
;; of pseudo-AI.
</pre>
<p>
It was most likely written by Richard Stallman. Note this subset of code:
<pre>
 (set (make-local-variable 'doctor--stallmanlst)
       '(((doc$ doctor--describe) your (doc$ doctor--feelings-about) him \.)
        ((doc$ doctor--areyou) a friend of Stallman \?)
	 ((doc$ doctor--bother) Stallman is (doc$ doctor--random-adjective) \?)
	  ((doc$ doctor--ibelieve) you are (doc$ doctor--afraidof) him \.)))
</pre>

It claims to use techniques "similar to the classic Eliza", but
doesn't say whether it is based upon Cosell's Lisp code or
Weizenbaum's paper. Although it is unknown whether Stallman actually
saw Cosell's version, it's pretty likely that he did, being a Lisp
hacker and at MIT around the time that the Lisp version would have
been making the rounds.

<h3>Various other, more recent, Elizas (Continuously Updated)</h3>

<font color=green>If you know of open source Elizas in any language roaming around,
please send me links or code so that I can add them to this section.</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=_blank
href=http://jeffshrager.org/llisp/26.html>Steve Cherry's 1982 Lisp
Eliza</a> 

<blockquote> 

[Okay, this is crazy: Cherry's version of Eliza appears in a book
called <a target=_blank href=http://shrager.org/llisp>"Learning
Lisp"</a>, which was an imprint of the manual for an Apple ][ Lisp,
written by Cherry, called <a target=_blank
href=http://www.flownet.com/ron/plisp.html>PLisp</a>. Cherry's Eliza
seems mostly based upon Shrager's 1973/1977 BASIC Eliza. (It has
essentially the same key and response structure as Shrager's, but has
a priority system, a ittle like Cosell's. So it's not a direct
translation, but is pretty close.) Shrager's Eliza had been ported to
an Apple ][ at some point, so Cherry would definately have had it
close to hand. Anyway, so bear with me here now: Cherry's PLisp manual
was actually a port of a Lisp textbook written by Shrager and a friend
(Steve Bagley) in about 1979. (See <a
href=http://shrager.org/llisp/preface.html target=_blank>the preface
to Learning Lisp</a>). HOWEVER, <i>Shrager and Bagley's book didn't
include an Eliza !! </i> Cherry apparently added it for either the
PLisp user's manual, or later for the imprinted book version of that
manual. What this means is that Cherry, probably unknowingly, borrowed
(fairly directly) Shrager's BASIC Eliza, which was itself borrowed
(indirectly) by Shrager from a Lisp program, back into a <i>different
Lisp program</i> to appear in a manual/book on Lisp originally
co-authored by Shrager, who wrote the original (BASIC) Eliza that
Cherry based <i>his</i> Lisp Eliza on ... Confusing enough for you!?]
